Arch1102_T3 2024: Architectural Design Studio 2 
Project One: Siting the Kiosk in Courtyard 
PROGRAM 
A mobile Kiosk (an OBJECT that expands, or partially expands + partially stationed) that opens and closes in Site A (see site map on page 4). 
It   is for the sale of light snacks, hot and   cold   beverages   and   art   supplies   during   the   day   and   can   be   closed   +   moved   into   or   next to a wall. The wall can be existing or   new. Provide three internal interconnected spaces:
1.            for storage;
2.            for preparation;
3.            for display and point   of sale.
Provide a covered external space for associated use considering   paved/unpaved   ground   surface   as well.
The point of sale is to take place   at   a window/open   counter   only.
Consider goods delivery and rubbish removal (night-time      off   hours).
Operating hours are 7am-7pm (only closed   on   public   holidays).   Building   must   be   closed   after operating   hours.
Think of the project as a series of architectural situations:
A boundary 
A window + open counter - a focus, destination
A canopy 
Rules/Limits 
•                Modulate the designs wholly within the space/courtyard (Site A) defined   by   B16,   B27,   B15 and   B14,   assuming
that the narrow  small rectangular structure   (4 x   9.5   sq.   meters)   attached   to   B27   is   not   there   (refer to   the   site drawing).   Propose a design for the entire extent of this zone. Kiosk interior 50 sq. meters max when open.
Covered external space 40 sq. meters min. The   remainder   of Zone A   is to   be   designed   as   an   in-between   space   loosely connecting the new opening/entrance from the   elevator core   in the   Library   (B14) to   the   Printing
Department (B16) and a breakout space for the   studios   in   B16      B27.
•             Zones   Band   C   are   part   of   B27.   Whilst   you   are   NOT   allowed   to   place   your   project within   these   zones,   you   are   required to integrate Zone   B at ground level, assuming that the wall to the southern end is removed and becomes part of the kiosk store space. 
• At least one external wall of your proposed design must be aligned with B27 (consider   the wall   a   linear   typology   with an ambiguous edge).
• Use entirely orthogonal geometry - no   curves   or diagonals.
•                The primary materials will be masonry   (floor   + wall)   and   timber –   internal floor and   roof structure   in   timber.
•                Lintels may be used over   door   and window   openings,   and   timber   can   also   be   used   for   joinery,   doors,   and   windows.
Associated Precedents 
Louis   Kahn,   De Vore   House (1955)
Mies van der Rohe,   Brick Country   House (1924)

Kiosk: Task One – Week 1
General   Notes for Task   1:
In all   projects, Task   1 requires you to represent the   nominated   precedent   building(s).   This   may   involve   preparing two-   or three-dimensional drawings or constructing three-dimensional studies. You will be asked to   prepare   this   material   based   on   available drawings and photographs. These exercises are designed   to   develop   and   improve your   skills   in: 
•             Analysing spatial strategies in   architectural   precedents.
•                Considering the relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional space.
•                Considering differences in various modes of architectural representations – photographs,   models,   perspectives, axonometric, digital models, etc.
In representing these works, bear in   mind that redrawing and model making/modelling involve a process of interpretation and abstraction. Models and drawings, depending on their scale,   medium,   materials,   methods of   construction, etc., can carry different ideas and express   various   material   and   spatial   sensibilities.
Task 1 
You will be provided with drawings for Kahn’s   DeVore   House   (1955),   Mies’   Brick   Country   House   (1924)   and   Siza’s swimming pool complex at   Leca de   Palmeira,   Portugal (1959-1973).   Photographs of the   pool   are   available   on   Moodle.
Based on these drawings/photographs, make a model (physically or digitally) of one of these projects @ no larger than 1:200. Due on W2. It can be representational or   interpretative,   e.g.,   how   movement   brings   indoor      outdoor spaces   together; opening and direction of light; structure and form   …   .
Please note: the available documents, particularly those   related to   the   Brick   Country   House,   are   limited   in   scope. You   should intelligently guess/interpret the overall design based on   these   drawings.
Kiosk: Task 2 - W2 
General   Notes for Task 2:
In all projects, Task 2 requires you to prepare two design options. The   two   options   need   to   be developed with reference to your precedent study (the assigned one and your   inspiration   drawn from   all   three),   your   interpretation   of the   site,   as well   as specific requirements stated in the   brief.   Each studio tutor will   promote   a   specific   and   particular attitude   to   the   analysis   of      the precedents, unpacking the relevance of this architectural   model   to your   site   and   project   brief.   In   preparing   your   two options, we also encourage you to explore the relationship   between your two 代 写Arch1102_T3 2024: Architectural Design Studio 2R
代做程序编程语言  proposals, clarifying   their   points   of distinction.      For example, you may choose to explore two distinct siting   options,   or you want   to   test   2 ways   of organising   the   relationship   between the point-of-sale   and the sheltered seating area... 
Task 2 
Produce two architectural responses to the brief as detailed   above.
For each option present:
A series of study models (massing and open-close   joinery design)   to   fit   into   your   sketch   site   model/3D   site   modelling. Diagrams identifying your site analysis + movement/circulation   on   site   and   implications for   design   (siting   the   design concepts).
Diagrams identifying spatial relations drawn from your precedent   studies   and   their   evolution   and   incorporation   into   the   design process (from concepts to architectural spaces and   places).
Min two sections @1:100. You should present as many   sections   as   required   to   communicate   your   spatial   effectively   strategies.
A plan or plans if more   than   one   area   for   kiosk   @1:100.
Scale bar must be present in every sketch design drawing. Drawings may be hand drawn or   in   Rhino.   Discuss   your   preferred   software   other than   Rhino with   your   tutor.   A   study   model      must accompany your sketch design. The SketchUp model   is   not   allowed for   design   development.   However,   a   section from   the SketchUp model, refined via   Illustrator, is welcome for weekly tutorial   discussion.
After discussion + feedback from your tutor, prepare one design   scheme for   Project   1-   Part   1   to   be   finalised   and   submitted   on   W4.
Task 3 - W3 
General   Notes for Task 3:
In all projects, Task 3 requires you to prepare one design scheme. This   is   developed   based   on   the   discussion   emerging   from Task 2.   For instance, the development of this scheme can emerge   from   reworking   one   of your   previous   options   or result in a hybrid model that   attempts to   bring   aspects   of the two   options   together.   In   developing   this   option,   you   are expected to repeat the processes discussed above. The   relationship   between   the   precedents,   development   of the themes, enquiries of the site, etc., are to be constantly scrutinised   and   reworked.   Through   this   critical   reflection   process,   your   designs can develop and gain subtle complexities.
Kiosk: Final Submission Presentation (20%, Week 4, 2 October). 
Model:
A series of refined study models (massing and   open-close   joinery   design)   to   fit   into   your   sketch   site   model.
Model @1:100. The model   must be refined   in   material   detail   and finish.   The   model   is   operatable,   and   the   interior   is   clearly   represented. The draft site model shows all three zones   (B27)   and   the   adjacent   buildings.   Construct   the   boundary wall   of B16,   B15 and the   Library (B14) adjacent to the courtyard and   B27.   Consult with   the   site   drawing   and   your tutor for   the   exact   boundary of the site model.   Each tutorial group might vary   slightly. 
For 3D modelling, situate   your Project   1   into the site   model   and   select   no   more   than   4   snapshots   that   best   represent   your   design of a kiosk   in the courtyard.
Drawings with scale bar (min requirement): 
Asite plan @1:500 showing the kiosk in   its   surrounding   context   and   boundaries   adjoining   buildings.
A plan(s) @1:100 at the ground level   showing   existing   context,   connection      circulation,   paved/unpaved ground,   and   landscape, if any. Show how the kiosk   moves   around when   open   and where   +   how   it   is   stored when   closed
A set of site mapping/analysis diagrams showing the places created by the kiosk and the canopy A long section @1:100 (including context) 
A short section @1:100 
Format: 5 minutes presentation with   10 minutes   (max) feedback   +   discussion
Medium:   Rhino (or equivalent software) and SketchUp refined   by   Illustrator   only. (Mainly line work with careful rendering in black, white and one selected colour)

Criteria for Review  Assessment 
This assessment is worth 20% of the total course assessment. You will   be assessed   on   the following   criteria:
•                Compliance with the   prescribed limits.
•                Clarity of architectural strategies as they have been   drawn from   precedents   and   their   translations   into   relevant   design strategies and spatial tactics.
•                Clarity of the relationship between the topics of siting, enclosure,   and   materials   in   reference to   the program.
•                Understanding of methods of assembly and construction: parts and whole of the mobile kiosk.
•                Precision and clarity of architectural representation.
