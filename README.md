Arch1102_T3 2024: Architectural Design Studio Two
Project Two: Bicycle Parking and Workshop + Kiosk in Courtyard 
with flexibility Week 6 (16 Oct): no studio class 
PROGRAM 
Program for the Kiosk is as for Project One 
Program for Bicycle Parking and Workshop 
A New Entrance Has Been Created for Bicycles (see site   map   on   page 4)
A. Parking: 
Provide free-standing, self-supporting, floor or wall-mounted bike parking stands for 30   bikes   (min.).
(see:   ‘FlatTop’   or   ‘Anaconda’ models as shown in The Bike Parking Handbook, p.   11,12 – document   available   on   Moodle resources.   Please note these examples are only   cited   as   a   guide for   dimensioning.   The   exact   design   of            the bike parking stands is   up   to   individual   students.)
B. Workshop: 
Staffed by one   person.   Free to   use.
Provide three interconnected spaces:
1.             Store (min. 20   meters squared)
2.             WC (for use by staff only – one toilet   and   one   basin)
3.            Workshop (min. 60 meters   squared)
(Provide:   10 meters long x 600mm wide, 900mm   high workbench, 3   bike   repair   stands, wall   hung   tool   rack/board; a tire pump zone.)
* - note: bench can   be continuous   (10   meters)   or split   into   smaller   bench   elements,   for   example,   3   x   3.3   meters   elements.
Think of the project as a series of architectural situations:
An outdoor court for people and   bikes
A workshop-front 
A sequence of working benches/stands
Consider goods delivery and rubbish removal.
Workshop operating hours are 7 am to   5   pm   (they are   only   closed   on   public   holidays).   The   building   must   be   closed   and secured after operating hours.
Users: Art school students/staff and the general public who are visiting the   Gallery and   the   Library.
Rules/Limits 
• The ground has to be excavated. Consider ramp and subterranean architecture. The area and location depend on the design within the given site boundary. 
•             You   may,   retain,   revise,   integrate,   add   to   or   entirely   redesign   the   kiosk from   project   one.
•             As your site, you must add Zone B to Zone A, assuming that the two long walls bordering Zone B, including the upper floors to the roof, are removed. No change   in   Zone   C   is   allowed. However,   you         can choose to connect with the existing stairs   in   B27.
•                Nominated minimum areas do not   include external walls.
•                Use entirely orthogonal geometry - no   curves   or diagonals.   The   roof   plane   may   be   angled.
•             Assemble the   building   using   planes,   folded   planes,   and   linear   elements   only.   See   the   definition   included   below.
•                Masonry and timber will be the primary   materials   used,   and   concrete   slabs will   be   used for the   floor.      Timber can also be used for   joinery, doors, and windows.   Lintels   may   be   used   over   door   and window   openings, and bike racks   may   be   metal.
Continuous flat planes: 
These are elements that have two of their dimensions of relatively   equivalent   size   compared to   their substantially smaller third dimension. The planes must   be flat   -   not   curved or folded.   They   must   maintain   their surface continuity as much as possible, which   means that   openings   such   as   doorways, windows, voids, etc. must be subservient to this   continuity.   Examples are   floors, walls,   ceilings,   roofs,   landings,   benchtops, screens and deep sills. 
Continuous folded planes: 
Each of these elements is made from a single   flat   plane   that   has   been   folded   at   least   once.   The   planes   must maintain their surface continuity as much   as   possible, which   means that   openings   such   as doorways, windows, voids, etc. must be subservient to this   continuity.   Examples   of folds are   extruded   L-, U-, Z-, O- shapes. The elements can be   floors,   walls,   ceilings,   roofs,   stairs,   awnings,   balustrades,   staircases and combinations of these. 
Linear elements: 
Those in which one of the three dimensions is substantially   longer than the   other two.
Examples are: columns, handrails, stair treads, sills,   architraves,   picture   rails,   skirtings, fascias,   shelves,   pipes and the individual elements   in screens.
Associated Precedents (see Moodle) 
Mies van der Rohe,   Barcelona   Pavilion (1929)
Le Corbusier: a selection of 2 housing   projects. Villa   Baizeau,   1928,   built   (Carthage, Tunisia)   and   Résidence   Peyrissac,   1942, unbuilt (domaine agricole, Cherchell, Algeria).
Tasks + Submission Requirements 
General   Notes for the 3 Tasks: 
Task 1: In all   projects, Task   1 requires you to represent the   nominated   precedent   building(s).   This   may   involve preparing two- or three-dimensional drawings or constructing three-dimensional studies. You will be   asked   to prepare this material based on available drawings   and   photographs.   These   exercises   are   designed to   develop   and   improve your skills in:
•             Analysing spatial   strategies   in   architectural   precedents.
•                Considering the relationship between two-dimensional drawings and three-dimensional space.
•                Considering differences in various modes of architectural representations   –   photographs,   models,   perspectives, axonometric, digital models, etc.
In representing these works, bear in mind   that redrawing and model-making involve a process of interpretation and abstraction. Models and drawings, depending on their scale,   medium,   materials,   methods of   cons代 写Arch1102_T3 2024: Architectural Design Studio Two  Project Two
代做程序编程语言truction, etc., can carry different ideas and   express various   material   and   spatial   sensibilities. 
Task 2: In all projects, Task 2 requires you   to prepare two design options. The   two   options   need   to   be developed with reference to your precedent study (the assigned   one   and   your   inspiration   drawn   from   all   six)   and your interpretation of the site, as well as specific   requirements stated   in the   brief.   Each   studio   tutor will promote a specific attitude to the analysis of the precedents.   It will   unpack   the   relevance   of this   architectural   model   to your site and project brief.   In preparing your   two   options we   also   encourage   you   to   explore   the   relationship between your two proposals, making clear their points   of distinction.   For   example, you   may   choose   to   explore   two   distinct siting options. Exactly the same process as in   Project One   applies:   a   series   of study   models,   diagrams   involving   siting   strategies   and spatial relations, sections, and plans   in   1/100 scale   must   accompany   your   early   stage   of design   development   and communication with your tutor.
Task 3: In all projects, Task 3   requires you to   prepare one design scheme.   This   is   to   be   developed   based   on discussion emerging from Task 2.   For instance, the development of this scheme   can   emerge from the   reworking   of one of your previous options or result in   a   hybrid   model that   attempts   to   bring   aspects   of the   two   together.   In developing this option, you are expected to repeat the   processes discussed   above.   The   relationship   between   the precedents, development of the themes, enquiries into the site, etc.,   are to   be   constantly   scrutinised   and   reworked.   It is through this process of critical reflection   that   your   designs   can   develop   and   gain   subtle complexities.

Criteria for Review  Assessment: 
Project 2 assessment is worth 20% of the total course   assessment. You will   be   assessed   on   the following   criteria:
•                Compliance with the prescribed limits: three interconnected spaces and excavated ground;
•                Clarity of architectural strategies as they have been   drawn from   precedents   and   their translations   into   relevant design strategies and spatial tactics;
•                Clarity of the relationship between the topics of siting,   enclosure   and   materials   in   reference   to the   program;
•                Understanding of methods of assembly and construction, including section(s) through excavated areas; 
•                Precision and clarity of architectural representation.
